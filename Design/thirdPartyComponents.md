## Surface - Material Design CSS Library

To help simplify and unify user interface creation, the Surface library was selected. It is lightweight, purely CSS, and entirely class-based. It offers material design aesthetics, but implements similar to Bootstrap or W3.CSS. Documentation is clear and easy. It can be found here:

## Handlebars JS
